# Leadership Impact Report

## 1. Introduction & Practicum Context
This Leadership Impact Report synthesizes insights from my health informatics
leadership practicum and applies data-driven analysis to an identified
organizational challenge. My practicum experience included observation of Epic
optimization governance meetings, interdisciplinary oversight discussions, and
safety huddles focused on workflow reliability and patient safety.

These experiences highlighted how informatics leadership plays a critical role
in aligning EHR functionality, clinical workflows, and organizational priorities
to improve patient engagement, operational efficiency, and care quality.

## 2. Leadership Question
How can informatics leadership use operational workflow data to reduce
appointment no-show rates, improve patient engagement, and enhance workflow
efficiency across clinical departments?

---

## 3. Data & Methods
This project used a simulated, de-identified operational workflow dataset
representing patient visits over a three-month period. The dataset included
fields related to department, visit type, appointment attendance, communication
channel, no-show reason, and service duration.

Basic descriptive analysis was conducted using Python to calculate no-show rates,
examine departmental variation, and assess communication-related patterns.
AI tools were subsequently used to generate leadership-focused insights, which
were critically evaluated based on organizational context and feasibility.

## 4. Key Findings
Analysis of the dataset revealed several actionable findings:

- The overall appointment no-show rate was approximately **40%**, indicating a
  significant opportunity for improvement in patient engagement and scheduling
  workflows.
- Departments relying primarily on portal-based communication experienced
  higher no-show rates compared to those using phone or in-person communication.
- The average service duration for attended visits was approximately
  **38 minutes**, with noticeable variability across departments, suggesting
  workflow inefficiencies and lack of standardization.

These findings suggest that communication strategy and workflow design are key
drivers of appointment adherence.

## 5. Summary of AI-Generated Insights
AI analysis identified communication gaps as a primary contributor to no-show
events, particularly inconsistent reminder workflows and limited use of
patient-preferred communication channels. The AI also highlighted the value of
department-level performance monitoring to identify variability in attendance
patterns.

Additional AI-generated recommendations included standardizing workflows,
expanding use of telehealth where appropriate, and leveraging dashboards to
support leadership oversight and data-informed decision-making.

## 6. Leadership Analysis
From a health informatics leadership perspective, the findings emphasize the
importance of structured governance and data transparency in workflow
optimization. Informatics leaders are uniquely positioned to translate
operational data into actionable insights that support both clinical and
organizational goals.

Leadership behaviors observed during my practicum—such as clear role assignment,
interdisciplinary collaboration, and accountability for Epic optimization—are
essential for implementing sustainable improvements. Effective leaders must
balance technological capabilities with real-world operational constraints to
ensure that data-driven initiatives are both feasible and impactful.

---

## 7. Action Plan
Based on the findings and leadership analysis, the following actions are
recommended:

1. Enhance Epic appointment reminder workflows to ensure consistent and timely
   outreach across all departments.
2. Align communication strategies with patient-preferred channels to improve
   engagement and reduce missed appointments.
3. Implement department-level dashboards to monitor no-show rates and workflow
   performance in real time.
4. Standardize scheduling and documentation workflows to reduce variability in
   service duration.
5. Establish regular leadership review meetings to evaluate performance metrics
   and guide continuous improvement efforts.

## 8. Reflection on Leadership Growth
This project strengthened my ability to approach operational challenges through
a leadership and informatics lens rather than a purely technical perspective. It
reinforced the importance of using data and AI as decision-support tools, while
applying professional judgment to assess feasibility and organizational fit.

Through this experience, I gained confidence in translating analytics into
leadership action plans and communicating insights in a way that supports
strategic decision-making. These skills will be critical in my continued
development as a health informatics leader.
