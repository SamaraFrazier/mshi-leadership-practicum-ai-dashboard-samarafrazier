# Leadership Impact Report

## Introduction and Practicum Context
This Leadership Impact Report summarizes insights gained during my health
informatics leadership practicum and applies data-driven analysis to an
identified organizational challenge. My practicum experience included
observations of Epic optimization governance, interdisciplinary oversight
meetings, and safety huddles focused on workflow reliability and patient safety.

These experiences highlighted the role of informatics leadership in aligning
technology, clinical workflows, and organizational priorities to improve
patient engagement, operational efficiency, and care quality.

## Leadership Question
How can informatics leadership improve operational workflows and communication
processes to reduce appointment no-shows, enhance patient engagement, and
support organizational performance?

---

## Data and Methods
This project used a simulated, de-identified operational workflow dataset
representing patient visits over a three-month period. The dataset included
information on appointment attendance, visit type, communication channels,
no-show reasons, and service duration.

Basic descriptive analysis was conducted using Python to examine no-show rates,
department-level variation, and communication-related patterns. AI tools were
then used to generate preliminary insights, which were critically evaluated
through a leadership and feasibility lens.

---

## Key Findings
Analysis of the dataset revealed several notable patterns:
- No-show events were frequently associated with communication gaps, such as
  lack of reminders or ineffective outreach.
- Variation in no-show rates across departments suggested inconsistent workflow
  effectiveness and patient engagement strategies.
- Service duration metrics for attended visits showed variability, indicating
  opportunities for workflow standardization and optimization.

These findings suggest that operational and communication processes play a
significant role in appointment adherence and care continuity.

## Leadership Analysis
From an informatics leadership perspective, the findings emphasize the
importance of leveraging EHR data to guide workflow optimization efforts.
Effective leaders can use these insights to identify gaps in communication,
monitor performance at the department level, and prioritize targeted
interventions.

Leadership behaviors observed during my practicum—such as structured governance,
clear role assignment, and interdisciplinary collaboration—are critical for
successfully implementing data-informed improvements. Informatics leaders serve
as the bridge between technical capabilities and clinical operations, ensuring
that optimization efforts align with organizational goals.

---

## Action Plan
Based on the analysis, the following leadership actions are recommended:
1. Optimize appointment reminder workflows within Epic to ensure consistent and
   timely patient outreach.
2. Leverage patient-preferred communication channels to improve engagement and
   reduce missed appointments.
3. Develop department-level dashboards to monitor no-show rates and workflow
   performance.
4. Standardize scheduling and documentation workflows where variability
   contributes to inefficiency.
5. Engage clinical and operational leaders in ongoing review of performance
   metrics to support continuous improvement.

## Reflection on Leadership Growth
This project strengthened my ability to approach operational challenges through
a leadership and informatics lens rather than a purely technical perspective. It
reinforced the importance of combining data analysis, AI-generated insights, and
contextual judgment to develop realistic and actionable solutions.

The experience also enhanced my confidence in using informatics tools to support
strategic decision-making and quality improvement initiatives, which will be
essential in my continued professional development as a health informatics
leader.
