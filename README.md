# Health Informatics Leadership Impact Dashboard  
**Using Operational Workflow Data to Inform Epic Optimization, Patient Safety, and Leadership Decision-Making**


## Project Overview  
This academic practicum project examines how informatics leadership can use
operational workflow data to improve patient engagement, reduce appointment
no-show rates, and support workflow optimization within a healthcare
organization. The project draws on observations from a leadership practicum
focused on Epic optimization governance, interdisciplinary oversight, and
patient safety.

## Practicum Context  
As part of my leadership practicum, I observed multiple leadership forums, including Epic Intake Oversight Council meetings, NOVA Honor Roll grant eligibility meetings, and hospital-wide safety huddles. These settings highlighted how leadership decisions related to Epic optimization directly impact safety readiness, clinician usability, and access to strategic funding opportunities.

## Leadership Question  
**How can informatics leadership improve Epic optimization governance to enhance patient safety, clinician usability, and organizational performance outcomes?**

## Data Description  
This project uses simulated, de-identified operational data over a three-month period. The dataset includes Epic optimization requests, safety-related workflow issues, leadership role assignment, and resolution outcomes.

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- GitHub  
- AI-assisted analysis
