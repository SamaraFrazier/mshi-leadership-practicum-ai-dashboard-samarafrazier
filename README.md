# Health Informatics Leadership Impact Dashboard  
Epic Optimization, Patient Safety, and Leadership Governance

## Project Overview  
This project examines how informatics leadership influences Epic optimization, patient safety, and organizational performance within a large academic health system. Using a simulated, de-identified operational dataset, the project explores patterns in Epic optimization requests and safety-related workflow issues to identify leadership-driven opportunities for improvement.

## Practicum Context  
As part of my leadership practicum, I observed multiple leadership forums, including Epic Intake Oversight Council meetings, NOVA Honor Roll grant eligibility meetings, and hospital-wide safety huddles. These settings highlighted how leadership decisions related to Epic optimization directly impact safety readiness, clinician usability, and access to strategic funding opportunities.

## Leadership Question  
How can informatics leadership improve Epic optimization governance to enhance patient safety, clinician usability, and organizational performance outcomes?

## Data Description  
This project uses simulated, de-identified operational data over a three-month period. The dataset includes Epic optimization requests, safety-related workflow issues, leadership role assignment, and resolution outcomes.

## Technologies Used  
Python, GitHub, AI-assisted analysis

> Note: This is an academic practicum project using simulated data and does not represent production hospital systems.
